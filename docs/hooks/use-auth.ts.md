-   **Path**: `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`
-   **Hook**: `useAuth`

## 1. Responsibility

This file defines the `useAuth` custom hook. The sole purpose of this hook is to provide a clean, simple, and type-safe way for components to access the `AuthContext`.

This is a common pattern in React for consuming context, as it offers several advantages over directly using `useContext(AuthContext)` in every component:
1.  **Abstraction**: It hides the implementation detail of which context is being used. If the context ever changed, you would only need to update this one hook.
2.  **Error Handling**: It includes a check to ensure that the hook is being used within an `AuthProvider`. If a component tries to use `useAuth` without being a descendant of `AuthProvider`, it will throw a helpful error, making debugging much easier.
3.  **Simplicity**: It makes the component code cleaner (`const { user } = useAuth()` vs. `const { user } = useContext(AuthContext)`).

## 2. Hook Breakdown

### `useAuth()`

This is the custom hook.

#### Core Logic
1.  **`const context = useContext(AuthContext)`**: It calls the built-in React `useContext` hook, passing `AuthContext` to it. This retrieves the `value` that was provided by the nearest `AuthProvider` up the component tree. This value is an object containing `user`, `login`, `logout`, `signup`, etc.
2.  **`if (!context)`**: It checks if the `context` value is `null` or `undefined`. This would happen if `useAuth` is called from a component that is not wrapped in `<AuthProvider>`.
3.  **`throw new Error(...)`**: If the context is missing, it throws an error with a clear message, immediately alerting the developer to the problem.
4.  **`return context`**: If the context exists, it is returned. The return type is `AuthContextType`, ensuring that any component using this hook gets full TypeScript autocompletion and type-checking for the context's value.

## 3. Data Flow

The `useAuth` hook itself doesn't manage data. It is a **conduit** for data and functions from the `AuthProvider`.

1.  **`AuthProvider`**: Provides the context value (containing `user`, `login`, etc.).
2.  **Component**: A component (e.g., `UserNav`, `ProfilePage`) calls `useAuth()`.
3.  **`useAuth`**: The hook accesses the context provided by `AuthProvider`.
4.  **Return Value**: The hook returns the entire context object to the component.
5.  **Component Usage**: The component can now destructure the properties it needs from the returned object, for example: `const { user, logout } = useAuth();`.

## 4. How it Fits In

`useAuth` is a small but crucial piece of the application's state management architecture. It acts as the official, sanctioned "gate" for accessing authentication state. By centralizing context access through this hook, the codebase becomes more maintainable, robust, and easier to read. It is the consumer-facing part of the `AuthContext` system, designed to be used by any component that needs to be aware of the user's authentication status or needs to trigger authentication-related actions.

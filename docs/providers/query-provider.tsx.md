-   **Path**: `src/providers/query-provider.tsx`
-   **Component**: `QueryProvider`

## 1. Responsibility

This file defines the `QueryProvider` component, which is responsible for setting up the **TanStack Query** (formerly React Query) library for the entire application.

Its sole responsibility is to:
1.  Create an instance of the `QueryClient`.
2.  Wrap the application with the `QueryClientProvider` component from TanStack Query.
3.  Provide the `queryClient` instance to the provider, making it available to any component that needs to use query hooks like `useQuery`.

## 2. Component Breakdown

### `QueryProvider({ children })`

#### Props
-   `children`: The `ReactNode` representing the rest of the application that will be wrapped by this provider.

#### State Management
-   **`queryClient`**:
    -   `const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());`
    -   This line creates the `QueryClient` instance. The `QueryClient` is the heart of TanStack Query; it's the engine that manages caching, refetching, and all other query logic.
    -   It is crucial that the `QueryClient` is **only created once** per application lifecycle. Wrapping the instantiation in `useState` with an initializer function (`useState(() => ...)`) is the standard way to achieve this. It ensures that `new QueryClient()` is only called on the very first render and the same instance is reused for all subsequent renders.

#### Rendering Logic
-   The component returns the `<QueryClientProvider>` component from the `@tanstack/react-query` library.
-   It passes the `queryClient` instance it created to the `client` prop of the provider.
-   It then renders its `{children}` inside the provider.

## 3. Data Flow

The `QueryProvider` doesn't manage application data directly like `AuthProvider` or `CartProvider`. Instead, it provides the **service** or **framework** for other components to manage their own server state.

1.  **Initialization**: `QueryProvider` is rendered at the top of the application tree (in `app-providers.tsx`). It creates the `queryClient` instance.
2.  **Consumption**: A component, like `DeliveryPage`, calls the `useQuery` hook:
    ```jsx
    const { data: restaurants, isLoading } = useQuery({
      queryKey: ['restaurants'],
      queryFn: fetchRestaurants,
    });
    ```
3.  **Hook Interaction**: The `useQuery` hook implicitly communicates with the `QueryClient` instance provided by `QueryProvider` via React's context system.
4.  **`QueryClient` Action**:
    -   The `queryClient` checks its cache for data associated with `queryKey: ['restaurants']`.
    -   If no valid data is found, it calls the `queryFn` (`fetchRestaurants`).
    -   It manages the `isLoading`, `isSuccess`, `isError` states.
    -   When the `fetchRestaurants` promise resolves, the `queryClient` stores the result in its cache and provides the data to the `DeliveryPage` component.
5.  **Component Re-render**: The `DeliveryPage` component re-renders with the fetched data and updated loading status.

## 4. How it Fits In

`QueryProvider` is an essential setup component for leveraging TanStack Query. It establishes the client-side cache and makes the query and mutation hooks available to the entire application. In this project, it's used by the `/delivery` page to handle the asynchronous fetching of restaurant data, demonstrating how to manage "server state" (even if mocked) in a clean, declarative, and powerful way.

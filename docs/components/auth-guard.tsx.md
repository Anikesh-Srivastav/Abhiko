-   **Path**: `src/components/auth-guard.tsx`
-   **Component**: `AuthGuard`

## 1. Responsibility

`AuthGuard` is a client-side wrapper component designed to protect specific pages or components from being accessed by unauthenticated users. While the main protection is handled by `(app)/layout.tsx`, this component can be used for more granular control on pages that might not be part of that layout group or for components that need to be strictly user-only.

**Note**: In the current project structure, its functionality is largely redundant because of the robust protection in `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`. However, it serves as a good example of an alternative or supplementary pattern for route protection.

Its key responsibilities are:
1.  Checking the user's authentication status via the `useAuth` hook.
2.  Redirecting unauthenticated users to the `/login` page.
3.  Rendering its `children` only if the user is authenticated.
4.  Displaying a loading spinner while the authentication check is in progress.

## 2. Component Breakdown

### `AuthGuard({ children })`

#### Props
-   `children`: The `ReactNode` representing the component or page content that needs to be protected.

#### Data Hooks
-   **`useAuth()`**: Provides access to the `user` object from the `AuthContext`.
-   **`useRouter()`**: Used to programmatically redirect the user.

#### Core Logic (`useEffect` Hook)

-   `useEffect(() => { ... }, [user, router])`
    -   This hook runs whenever the `user` object or `router` instance changes.
    -   It checks if `user === null`.
    -   If the user is not authenticated, it calls `router.push('/login')` to redirect them.

    *Self-Correction*: Unlike `(app)/layout.tsx`, this component does **not** use the `isMounted` state check. In a complex app, this could potentially lead to a brief flash of content on the client before the redirect happens. The pattern in `(app)/layout.tsx` is generally more robust for handling client-side-only data like sessions from `localStorage`.

#### Rendering Logic

-   **Loading/Unauthenticated State**: `if (!user)`
    -   If the `user` object is `null` (either because the user is logged out or the auth state is still being determined), the component renders a full-page loading spinner. This prevents the protected `children` from being rendered.
-   **Authenticated State**: `return <>{children}</>;`
    -   If the `user` object exists, the guard "opens," and the child components are rendered as normal.

## 3. Data Flow

1.  **Component Mount**: A page using `AuthGuard` mounts (e.g., `<AuthGuard><MyProtectedPage /></AuthGuard>`).
2.  **Auth Check**: `useAuth()` is called. The `user` object is retrieved from `AuthContext`.
3.  **Conditional Render**:
    -   **Case 1 (User Logged In)**: `user` is not `null`. The `if (!user)` check fails, and `{children}` are rendered.
    -   **Case 2 (User Not Logged In)**: `user` is `null`. The `if (!user)` condition is true, and the loading spinner is rendered.
4.  **Side Effect**: The `useEffect` hook runs. Since `user` is `null`, `router.push('/login')` is called, and the user is redirected away from the page.

## 4. How it Fits In

`AuthGuard` is a classic example of a Higher-Order Component (HOC) pattern (though used here as a wrapper) for handling authentication in React. It encapsulates the protection logic, allowing you to wrap any component that requires a user to be logged in.

While the primary authentication enforcement in this app is handled at the layout level, `AuthGuard` remains a valuable and reusable utility for cases requiring component-level protection. For instance, you could use it to hide a "Comment" form component within a public page, rather than protecting the entire page itself.

-   **Path**: `src/app/(app)/dine-in/page.tsx`
-   **Component**: `DineInPage`, `DesktopFallback`, `MobileFallback`, `Fallback`

## 1. Responsibility

This file defines the user experience for the **Dine-In** feature, which is intended to be a QR-code-based ordering system. As the feature is not fully implemented, this page serves as a sophisticated, device-aware placeholder. Its primary responsibilities are:
1.  Prompting the user with a dialog to see how the feature would work.
2.  Detecting whether the user is on a mobile or desktop device using the `useIsMobile` hook.
3.  Displaying a witty, context-specific message based on the user's device type and their choice in the dialog.
4.  Guiding the user to other available features if they opt out.

## 2. Component Breakdown

### `DesktopFallback()`
-   A simple component that renders a `Card` with a message tailored for desktop users, explaining that QR code scanning isn't possible and wittily suggests hiring the developer.

### `MobileFallback()`
-   A simple component that renders a `Card` with a message tailored for mobile users, humorously stating the feature is "still cooking" and that hiring the developer would speed it up.

### `Fallback()`
-   A generic component that renders a `Card` guiding the user to browse other features if they choose not to proceed with the dine-in demo.

### `DineInPage()`
This is the main component that orchestrates the logic for the page.

#### State Management
-   **`choice`**: A state (`useState`) that can be `'yes'`, `'no'`, or `null`. It tracks the user's selection from the initial dialog. `null` is the initial state, forcing the dialog to be open.

#### Data Hooks
-   **`useIsMobile`**: A custom hook that returns `true` or `false` based on the screen width, allowing for device-specific logic.

#### Core Logic

-   **Initial State**: The page loads with `choice` as `null`. This keeps the `AlertDialog` open, forcing the user to make a decision.
-   **Dialog Interaction**:
    -   The `AlertDialog` is controlled by the `choice === null` condition.
    -   Clicking "Yes, show me" sets `choice` to `'yes'`.
    -   Clicking "No, maybe later" sets `choice` to `'no'`.
    -   If the dialog is closed without a choice, an `onOpenChange` handler also sets `choice` to `'no'` as a fallback.
-   **Conditional Rendering**: After a choice is made, the `content` variable is populated based on a series of `if/else` statements:
    -   If `choice === 'yes'`, it further checks `isMobile`. It renders `<MobileFallback />` for mobile and `<DesktopFallback />` for desktop.
    -   If `choice === 'no'`, it renders `<Fallback />`.
-   **SSR Guard**: The component returns `null` if `isMobile` is `undefined` on the initial server render to prevent hydration mismatches, as the hook can only determine the device type on the client.

## 3. Data Flow

1.  **Page Load**: The component renders, `choice` is `null`.
2.  **UI State**: The `AlertDialog` is displayed to the user.
3.  **User Input**: The user clicks one of the buttons in the dialog.
4.  **State Update**: The `onClick` handler updates the `choice` state to either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
5.  **Re-render**: The component re-renders with the new `choice` value.
6.  **Conditional Logic**: The `if/else` block executes, and the `useIsMobile` hook's return value determines which of the fallback components is rendered to the user.

## 4. How it Fits In

This page is a clever and professional way to handle a feature that is planned but not yet implemented. Instead of showing a broken or empty page, it engages the user, showcases the developer's personality, and smoothly redirects them to working parts of the application. It demonstrates:
-   Effective use of a modal dialog (`AlertDialog`) to control user flow.
-   Device-aware rendering using a custom hook (`useIsMobile`).
-   Good UX practices for handling "work-in-progress" features.
